### API Sources

The functions above utilize different Formula 1 data sources:

- **Official F1 Live Timing API (OpenF1)**: Used for all real-time data
- **Ergest API (FastF1)**: Used for historical data

## Getting Started (Lights Out and Away We Go!)

1.  **Get the Code:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Panth1823/formula1-mcp
    cd formula1-mcp # Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

üèÅ **Checkered Flag!** The server is built and ready to be configured in your MCP client.

## Installation & Configuration

Once built, tell your MCP client where to find the server. Add the following configuration to the appropriate JSON file for your client:

- **Cursor:** `%APPDATA%\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows), `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (MacOS), `~/.config/.cursor/mcp.json` (Linux)
- **Claude Desktop:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (MacOS)
- _(Other clients might have different paths)_

**Configuration Example:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "formula1": {
      "command": "node",
      // ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Replace <path-to-your-cloned-repo> with the *absolute* path!
      "args": ["<path-to-your-cloned-repo>/build/index.js"],
      // ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Ensure this points to the root of *your* cloned repo
      "cwd": "<path-to-your-cloned-repo>",
      "enabled": true // Set to true to activate!
    }
  }
}
```

_Double-check those paths! An incorrect path is like a pit stop error ‚Äì it'll cost you time._

## Example Prompts (Start Your Engines!)

Here are a few examples of how you might interact with the Formula 1 MCP server in a compatible client (like Cursor or Claude Desktop):

- "Show me the race results for the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix." (Uses `getHistoricalSessions` then `getHistoricRaceResults`)
- "Get the driver standings for the 1998 F1 season." (Uses `getDriverStandings`)
- "What was the constructor championship table in 2010?" (Uses `getConstructorStandings`)
- "Tell me about the Silverstone circuit." (Uses `getCircuitInfo`)
- "Fetch Lewis Hamilton's lap times from the 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix." (Uses `getHistoricalSessions` then `getLapTimes`)
- "Show the race calendar for 2024." (Uses `getRaceCalendar`)
- "Get information about the driver Max Verstappen." (Uses `getDriverInformation` or `getDriverInfo`)
- "What were the qualifying results for the 2022 Japanese GP?" (Uses `getHistoricalSessions` then `getQualifyingResults`)
- "List the available F1 seasons." (Uses `getSeasonList`)

_(Remember to replace specific years, circuits, drivers, or rounds with your actual query!)_

## Debugging (Box, Box, Box!)

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

Follow the instructions in the MCP Inspector repository to set it up.

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
